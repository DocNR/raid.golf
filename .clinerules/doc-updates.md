## Brief overview
- Lightweight, general rule: keep documentation in sync with major milestones.

## Documentation updates after milestones
- After completing a major phase/step or milestone, update relevant documentation before closing work.
- Minimum updates usually include `CHANGELOG.md` plus the primary phase/milestone tracker (e.g., `docs/implementation_phases.md` when present).
- If a change introduces new public interfaces or workflow changes, update any additional docs that describe usage or workflow.

## Commit hygiene
- Prefer amending the milestone/phase completion commit to include required documentation updates when feasible.
