# Summaries

This folder contains derived data generated from raw session logs.

Examples:
- Session-level A/B/C breakdowns
- A-shot-only averages
- Rolling trends by club

Rules:
- Files here are generated, not edited manually
- Data can be deleted and rebuilt at any time
- Nothing in this folder is canonical
- Any summary involving classification must include the KPI version used (`kpi_version`).

Canonical truth lives in:
- docs/
- the practice system
- the spreadsheet log
