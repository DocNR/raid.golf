# Strike-Quality Practice Session Plan  
**Purpose:** Improve contact quality and raise A-shot percentage while preserving speed gains  
**Primary Tool:** Rapsodo MLM2PRO  
**Current Baseline Club:** 7-iron (only club with validated data so far)

---

## Core Principle
Practice is **quality-filtered**, not volume-based.  
A shot only “counts” if it meets defined strike-quality KPIs. All gapping and stock yardages are derived **only from A-shots**.

---

## Metrics to Display on Rapsodo (4 max)
Use the same four metrics every session for consistency:

1. **Smash Factor**  
2. **Ball Speed**  
3. **Spin Rate**  
4. **Descent Angle**

> Carry distance is reviewed **after the session**, not during.

---

## 7-Iron Strike-Quality KPIs (Validated)
These thresholds are derived from your existing dataset and are **locked for now**.

### A-Shot (Counts for gapping)
- Smash Factor **≥ 1.25**
- Ball Speed **≥ 104 mph**
- Spin Rate **≥ 4,300 rpm**
- Descent Angle **≥ 45°**

### B-Shot (Borderline / informational)
- Smash **1.22–1.24**
- Spin **≥ 4,200 rpm**
- Descent **≥ 44°**

### C-Shot (Outlier — does NOT count)
- Smash **< 1.22**  
  **OR**
- Spin **< 4,100 rpm**  
  **OR**
- Descent **< 43°**

---

## Practice Session Structure (60 minutes)

### 1. Setup (5 min)
- Select **one club only** (7-iron)
- Confirm the 4 displayed metrics
- Single target, neutral conditions

---

### 2. Warm-Up Phase (10 min)
**Goal:** Loosen up, stabilize tempo  
- Start ~50–60% effort
- Gradually ramp to stock swing
- Ignore A/B/C classification
- No mechanical corrections yet

---

### 3. Strike Block – Primary Work (25 min)
**Goal:** Accumulate clean reps only

**Rules**
- Same target, same swing
- After each shot, check only the 4 metrics
- No swing thoughts during motion

**Objective**
- Accumulate **10 A-shots**
- B-shots are ignored
- After any C-shot: step away for 10–15 seconds

**Safety Valve**
- 3 C-shots in a row → stop for 2 minutes

---

### 4. Pressure Block (10 min)
**Goal:** Improve A-shot percentage under constraint

- Work in **5-ball sets**
- Requirement: **3 A-shots out of 5**
- If failed:
  - 1-minute reset
  - Repeat once only

---

### 5. Optional Speed Transfer (5–10 min)
*Only if not fatigued*

- 3–5 swings at **+5–7% intent**
- Same strike KPIs apply
- Abort immediately if smash drops

---

### 6. Cooldown & Save (5 min)
- Save session in Rapsodo
- Export and download **CSV**

---

## Post-Session Workflow
1. Download the CSV from Rapsodo  
2. Upload it for analysis  
3. Add brief notes:
   - Club used
   - Fatigue level
   - Any notable feels or intent changes

**Analysis performed:**
- A / B / C shot breakdown
- True stock carry (A-shots only)
- Miss-type distribution
- A-shot % trend over time
- KPI adjustments (when justified)

---

## Club Selection Strategy
- **One club per session** is recommended  
- Two clubs max only if adjacent (e.g., 7i + 6i)
- Wedges may be grouped
- Long irons (5i) require dedicated sessions

---

## Suggested KPIs for Other Irons (Preliminary)
> ⚠️ These are **placeholders only**.  
> Only the 7-iron KPIs are validated.  
> Thresholds will be adjusted once sufficient data is collected.

### 6-Iron (tentative)
- Smash ≥ 1.30  
- Ball Speed ≥ TBD  
- Spin ≥ ~4,000 rpm  
- Descent ≥ ~43°

### 5-Iron (tentative)
- Smash ≥ 1.32  
- Ball Speed ≥ TBD  
- Spin ≥ ~3,800 rpm  
- Descent ≥ ~41°

*Exact values will be set after 2–3 full datasets per club.*

---

## Key KPIs to Track Over Time
- **A-shot percentage**
- **Average A-shot carry**
- **A-shot dispersion**
- **C-shot cause distribution (low smash vs low spin)**

---

## Success Criteria
- Short term (4–8 weeks):  
  - Raise 7-iron A-shot % from ~54% → **60–65%**
- Long term:  
  - Maintain A-shot % while gradually increasing stock speed

---

**Rule of thumb:**  
*Do not fix C-shots. Exclude them. Train the pattern that produces A-shots.*
