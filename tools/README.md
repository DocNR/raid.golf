# Tools

This folder contains non-canonical utilities used to analyze practice data.

Contents may include:
- Analysis scripts
- Temporary notes
- Exploratory code
- KPI configuration files

Rules:
- Files here may change frequently
- Nothing here overrides canonical documents in `/docs`
- Outputs produced by tools must go to `data/summaries/`

This folder is procedural, not authoritative.
